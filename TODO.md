Need to:
- Better cross-browser support
- video slides
- Create legit vis.html
- support concurrent states
- Add default states changer
- Three hotspot suppression techniques: delay, show on failure, or show while a key is pressed

It would be nice to:
- undo / redo in tracker
- undo / redo in the editor
- Easier install (bundle everything into a single, double-clickable app?)
- Webcam (+ image processing?) / way to add images to the directory
- Live chat / notes (need to check out simplewebrtc.com) for qualitative data collection
- Add surveys before / after tracking
- Fancier hotspot editing (e.g. curves, proper pen tool)
- More interactions (keyboard, touch events)
- Better dragging feedback (cursors?)
- Manage / serve multiple projects
