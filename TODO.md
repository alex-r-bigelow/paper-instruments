Need to:
- Add transition tracking
- Finish editor
- Restart on vis.html

It would be nice to:
- Easier install (bundle everything into a single, double-clickable app?)
- Webcam (+ image processing?) / way to add images to the directory
- Manage / serve multiple projects
- Add surveys before / after tracking
- Fancier hotspot editing (e.g. curves, proper pen tool)
- More interactions (keyboard, touch events)
- Make dragging live
