Need to:
- Create legit vis.html
- Hide hot spots until either the user has clicked somewhere that doesn't work, or maybe a timer would be better?

It would be nice to:
- Easier install (bundle everything into a single, double-clickable app?)
- Webcam (+ image processing?) / way to add images to the directory
- Manage / serve multiple projects
- Add surveys before / after tracking
- Fancier hotspot editing (e.g. curves, proper pen tool)
- Layer sets instead of slides?
- More interactions (keyboard, touch events)
- Make dragging actually drag something visually
