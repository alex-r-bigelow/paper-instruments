Need to:
- Abstract heat map characterizing process
- Fix mouse tracking, add tracking analysis visualizations

It would be nice to:
- State Layers chart (part of complete editor?)
- Revisit cross-browser support issues
- video slides
- Three hotspot suppression techniques: delay, show on failure, or show while a key is pressed
- undo / redo support
- complete editor (not just path edits)
- Easier install (bundle everything into a single, double-clickable app?)
- Webcam (+ image processing?) / way to add images to the directory
- Live chat / notes (need to check out simplewebrtc.com) for qualitative data collection
- Add surveys before / after tracking - maybe there's a way to connect a tracking session with google forms?
- Fancier hotspot editing (e.g. curves, proper pen tool)
- More interactions (keyboard, touch events)
- Manage / serve multiple projects
