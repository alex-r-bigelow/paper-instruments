Need to:
- Add transition tracking
- Restart on vis.html
- Bug: changing a slide's name doesn't auto-update references to it from other slides?
- Bug: preview back button doesn't work
- Bug: need to be able to right-click or drag on the same area

It would be nice to:
- Easier install (bundle everything into a single, double-clickable app?)
- Webcam (+ image processing?) / way to add images to the directory
- Manage / serve multiple projects
- Add surveys before / after tracking
- Fancier hotspot editing (e.g. curves, proper pen tool)
- More interactions (keyboard, touch events)
- Make dragging live
